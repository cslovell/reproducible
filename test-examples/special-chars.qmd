# Test Content

This chapter has special characters in the version string to test URL encoding.

Expected behavior:
- Button should appear
- Version should be normalized (dots → hyphens): v1-2-3-beta+build.456
- Special characters (+ and .) should be URL-encoded in the final URL
- Generated URL should be valid
